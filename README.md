# Go Design Patterns

## Factory

Factory pattern is a commonly used creational design pattern. It is normally used when the user is expected to choose between multiple options.

## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern. It is used when we need to create multiple families of similar products.

## Builder

The builder pattern is a creational design pattern. It is used when the creation of a product involves multiple, independent steps.

## Adapter

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern. It allows 2 or more incompatible objects to interface with each other.

## Bridge

The bridge is a structural design pattern that helps in splitting up a complex piece of code into multiple parts so that each part can be developed, scaled and maintained independently.

## Decorator

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that is used when we need to enhance the functionality of a given object without changing it's interface.

In this pattern, we usually have a base/bare-bones class that implements a certain interface. Along with this, we have multiple "wrapper" classes that allow users to enhance the methods of the base class without changing the interface.

This means that even the "Wrapper" classes implement the same interface

## Facade

The facade pattern is a structural design pattern, commonly used when there is some interaction with a complex external library or service.

## Flyweight

The Flyweight design pattern is a structural design pattern commonly used when we want to group similar data for multiple objects. The primary intent of this pattern is to store common data for multiple objects in a single place and hence optimise for memory usage.

## Chain of Responsibility

The Chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that deals with breaking down a complex problem into sequentially occurring steps. At each step, there is a possibility of moving to the next step or exiting from the chain.
